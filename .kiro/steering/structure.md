# Project Structure

This workspace is currently in initial setup phase. The project structure will be established as development begins.

## Directory Organization
The following structure should be followed as the project grows:

```
/
├── .kiro/              # Kiro configuration and steering rules
│   └── steering/       # AI assistant guidance documents
├── src/                # Source code (when applicable)
├── tests/              # Test files
├── docs/               # Documentation
├── config/             # Configuration files
└── README.md           # Project overview and setup instructions
```

## File Naming Conventions
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Follow language-specific conventions (camelCase, snake_case, etc.)
- Keep file names concise but meaningful
- Use consistent naming patterns across similar file types

## Code Organization
- Group related functionality together
- Separate concerns appropriately
- Use meaningful directory names that reflect their purpose
- Keep configuration files at appropriate levels
- Maintain clean separation between source code, tests, and documentation

## Best Practices
- Keep the root directory clean and organized
- Use appropriate file extensions
- Maintain consistent indentation and formatting
- Document the purpose of each major directory
- Follow established patterns within the chosen technology stack
